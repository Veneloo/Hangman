## Game Rules

1. Player 1 thinks of a word and notes down the number of characters in it without revealing the word to Player 2.
2. Player 2 starts guessing letters one at a time.
3. If Player 2 guesses a letter that is present in the word, Player 1 reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word.
4. If Player 2 guesses a letter that is not in the word, Player 1 marks it as a wrong guess.
5. Player 2 continues guessing letters until they can either successfully guess the entire word or make a maximum number of wrong guesses.
6. If Player 2 guesses the entire word correctly, they win. Otherwise, Player 1 wins.
